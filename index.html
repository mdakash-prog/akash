<div id="am">      Here at Auto Technik, we not only maintain and service all things BMW, but we are passionate about the BMW brand itself. We often have customers come through to our workshop asking us for advice about buying a BMW. Well, we’ve compiled the following list on the top reasons you should invest in a BMW if you are thinking about. After all, a BMW no matter what model is still a BMW! And there comes a certain prestige associated with this vehicle.

4) Safety Features

BMW’s are commonly known as being a luxury car, with many added features and extras. However, with this comes a luxury feel of safety within the vehicle also. There are multi safety features within the car itself that minimize the feel of an impact. And as technology advances further, features like blind-spot warning controls will further emphasize the safety features within your BMW.

3) Longevity and Durability

One of the things that we often hear from people is how BMW’s are expensive to maintain. Whilst this may be true to a certain degree, the truth is that if you look after your car well, it most likely will not need too much expensive maintenance… in other words, do not drive like a maniac! Or you will incur the costs. By driving safely, you not only ensure your own safety and others, but you are effectively keeping the car in the same shape you brought it in.
